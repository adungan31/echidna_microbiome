# echidna_microbiome
QIIME2 and R code for "Faecal microbiota in the short-beaked echidna (*Tachyglossus aculeatus*) shows stability across gestation"

All raw data from the Illumina MiSeq run are available under NCBI BioProject ID PRJNA971374. 

## Files provided
1. Echidna_metarbarcoding_QIIME2.pdf: This outlines the QIIME2 code for processing all raw data files, generating the precursor files for data analysis in R. Users unfamiliar with QIIME2 can follow along with [a tutorial I designed in partnership with Melbourne Bioinformatics](https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/tutorials/tutorials/qiime2/qiime2/) 
2. Data files used for analysis in R:

   a. metadata.txt
 
   b. taxonomy.txt
 
   c. asv.txt
 
   d. tree.nwk

4. R code files:
 
   a. 1_import_data.R

   b. 2_decontam.R

   c. 3_diversity_metrics.R

   d. 3_diversity_metrics_stats.R

   e. 4_PCoA.R

   f. 5_barplots.R

   g. 6_PERMANOVA.R

   h. 8_indicator_taxa.R

   i. 10_most_abundant_ASVs.R

   j. rarefaction_curve.R: This file allows the user to take the downloaded rarefaction curve file from QIIME2 and turn it into a plot in R. There are caveats here: 1) this will only work if you ran the rarefaction curve as shown in the QIIME2 code provided, and 2) all blank spaces in the file need to be replaced with NA. This file came from another project (platypus) but you can replace file names to suit you.
